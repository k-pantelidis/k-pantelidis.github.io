# TVL to MC Ratio

Total Value Locked (TVL) represents the total dollar value of assets that are currently staked or locked in a specific DeFi protocol, measuring the liquidity of a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. By dividing the TVL to the Market Capitalization (MC) of an asset $$i$$ at time $$t$$, we get their respective ratio, denoted as $$TVLMC$$.

$$
TVLMC_{t,i} = \frac{\text{TVL}_{t,i}}{\text{MC}_{t,i}}
$$

The $$TVLMC$$ could be useful information regarding the relative value of the examined asset for valuation assessment or market sentiment indicator purposes.
